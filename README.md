# genetic-guitar
A small genetic algorithm written in python 2.7 for generating guitar riffs.

Written for Algorithms in Nature (02-317) at Carnegie Mellon. 

Can be run via:
```bash
$ python GRGA.py
```
Currently runs for 100 generations prints the best and worst scoring guitar riff for every 10th generation.

TO-DO:
- [ ] Allow final generation to be written to file
- [ ] Add args parser and allow interactivity
- [ ] Allow for user-favored chord scoring
- [ ] To be determined...
